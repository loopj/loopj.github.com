    James Smith, British entrepreneur and software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

    I co-founded <a href="https://bugsnag.com">Bugsnag</a> in 2012, a popular
    real-time crash detection service for mobile and web applications, with
    <a href="http://snmaynard.com">Simon Maynard</a>. Bugsnag was acquired by
    SmartBear Software in 2021.

    From 2009 to 2012 I led the product team as CTO of mobile gaming platform
    Heyzap.

    I've also built a number of <a href="https://github.com/loopj">popular
