title: NVD3 Erased From Existence
---

I was incredibly surprised to find out today that the popular graphing 
library NVD3 has been erased from the web, due to what what looks like a 
copyright dispute.

The following message was sent to admins of the nvd3 organization on GitHub:

> Good day to you, admins of GitHub organization "nvd3".
> I'm writing on behalf of Novus Partners, the company that developed nvd3. 
> This code has been released in open source form by mistake. The employee 
> who put it out never obtained proper permission from management.

> In light of this, I regret to inform you that your repository is in 
> violation of our copyright, and respectfully request that you remove it from
> GitHub as well as delete any copies of nvd3 source code from your systems.
> Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconvenience.

> Best regards,
> Max Afonov, Novus Partners, Inc.
